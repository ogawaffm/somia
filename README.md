# SOMIA - Schema Object Model Interface and API

Somia can be used to read a database schema into an object model. This model consists of various classes that describe 
the objects of the schema, such as

* tables
* columns
* primary keys
* indexes
* relations

The model information can be used to document the database schema or to generate scripts that create, modify or delete 
these objects.
